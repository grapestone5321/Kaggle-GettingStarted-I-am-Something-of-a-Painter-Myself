### Goal

We recognize the works of artists through their unique style, such as color choices or brush strokes. 

The “je ne sais quoi” of artists like Claude Monet can now be imitated with algorithms thanks to generative adversarial networks (GANs). 

In this getting started competition, you will bring that style to your photos or recreate the style from scratch!

### Recommended Tutorial
We highly recommend **Amy Jang's notebook** that goes over the basics of loading data from TFRecords, using TPUs, and building a CycleGAN.
